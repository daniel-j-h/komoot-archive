# Komoot Archive

We keep an eye on Komoot's terms of services and archives them for posterity and transparency.

In March 2025 Komoot got acquired by Bending Spoons.
Looking at their acquisition history I want to hold them accountable for any changes to the user and customer relationship.

This repository runs a Github Action on a regular basis to store Komoot's terms of services for posterity and transparency.

Find the archive [here](./shots).

Note: This project is in no way related or affiliated with Komoot. We just like the product.
